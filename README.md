# Overview
The database solution presented in this report is for a small retail company named Beauty Co. (not a real company)- an Australian online cosmetic retailer startup. They sell cosmetics to customers who live in Australia. Due to its small size, the company is located in one building with 5 floors. Hence the company needs a place to keep all data from staff members and customers, thus having a database with 6 strong entries and 8 weak entities store the appropriate data, where now the company can access all necessary information.
